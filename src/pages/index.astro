        Indexing blockchain events is crucial for dApps as it enables quick and efficient access to
        relevant data stored on the blockchain, which is required for executing Smart Contracts and
        providing a seamless user experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        Without indexing, the process of searching and retrieving data from the blockchain would be slow
        and cumbersome, negatively impacting the functionality and usability of dApps.
